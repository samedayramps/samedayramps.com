## Homepage Structure & Content Strategy

The homepage will be structured to guide visitors through a narrative that addresses their pain points, presents your solution, builds trust, and makes it easy to take action.

### 1. Hero Section: Immediate Problem Solving

**Goal**: Capture the user who is in a "timing crisis" and needs an immediate, trustworthy solution.

-   **Headline**: **"Need a Wheelchair Ramp by Tomorrow? We Deliver."** (Directly addresses urgency)
-   **Sub-headline**: "Fast, professional, and safe aluminum wheelchair ramp rentals in Dallas-Fort Worth. Installation in as little as 24 hours."
-   **Visual**: A high-quality photo of a clean, professionally installed aluminum ramp leading into a welcoming home.
-   **Primary CTA**: A prominent `Button` that says **"Get a Free Quote Now"**.
-   **Secondary CTA**: A `Button` with an "outline" variant that says **"See How It Works"**, which links to the process section below.

### 2. "Why Choose Same Day Ramps?": Your Key Differentiators

**Goal**: Quickly show visitors why you are the best choice, addressing their core concerns about safety, cost, and flexibility.

-   **Layout**: A clean, 4-column grid. Each column will feature an icon, a heading, and a short description. This avoids "card overuse" and is easy to scan.
-   **Content**:
    -   **Speed**: "Installation in 24 Hours. We provide access when you need it most, without the wait."
    -   **Safety**: "Professional-Grade Ramps. 1,000 lb capacity aluminum ramps, installed by experts."
    -   **Flexibility**: "Simple Monthly Rentals. No long-term contracts. We pick it up for free when you're done."
    -   **Worry-Free Service**: "We Handle Everything. From delivery and professional installation to removal."
-   **shadcn/ui Components**: Use `lucide-react` icons (like `Clock`, `Shield`, `Calendar`, `Wrench`) for visual appeal.

### 3. "Our Simple, Worry-Free Process": Building Confidence

**Goal**: Demystify the rental process and show how easy it is to work with you.

-   **Heading**: **"Get a Safe, Reliable Ramp in 3 Easy Steps"**
-   **Layout**: A simple, visual timeline.
-   **Content**:
    1.  **Free Consultation**: "Call us for a quick, no-obligation quote. We'll assess your needs and provide clear, upfront pricing."
    2.  **Professional Installation**: "Our trained technicians deliver and install your ramp, ensuring it's safe, secure, and ready to use."
    3.  **Hassle-Free Removal**: "When your rental period is over, we'll schedule a convenient time to remove the ramp at no extra cost."
-   **shadcn/ui Components**: `Separator` to create the visual timeline.

### 4. Who We Help: Targeting Customer Scenarios

**Goal**: Allow visitors to self-identify with a specific situation, making the service feel more relevant to them.

-   **Heading**: **"Solutions for Every Temporary Need"**
-   **Layout**: Use the `Tabs` component for a clean, interactive way to display information without clutter.
-   **shadcn/ui Components**: `Tabs`
    -   **Tab 1: Post-Surgery & Recovery**: Content focused on the urgent need after hospital discharge (hip/knee surgery). Use an image of a person recovering comfortably at home.
    -   **Tab 2: Aging in Place**: Content focused on trying out a solution before committing, for seasonal needs, or for visiting family. Use an image of an elderly person confidently using a ramp.
    -   **Tab 3: Transitional & Hospice**: Content focused on dignity and peace of mind during difficult transitions or end-of-life care.

### 5. Testimonials: Real-World Social Proof

**Goal**: Build powerful trust by showing how you've helped others in similar situations.

-   **Heading**: **"One Less Thing to Worry About"** (Emotional Appeal)
-   **Layout**: Use the `Card` component here, as it's perfect for highlighting distinct quotes.
-   **Content**: Feature 2-3 strong testimonials.
    -   **Testimonial 1 (Focus on Speed)**: *"The hospital told us Dad needed a ramp to be discharged. I called Same Day Ramps, and they had a professional, sturdy ramp installed the very next day. It was a lifesaver."* - The Johnson Family, Dallas
    -   **Testimonial 2 (Focus on Peace of Mind)**: *"I was so worried about my husband using a flimsy DIY ramp after his surgery. The quality and professional installation from Same Day Ramps gave us both incredible peace of mind."* - S. Williams, Fort Worth
-   **shadcn/ui Components**: `Card`, `Avatar` (for client photos if available).

### 6. FAQ: Overcoming Objections

**Goal**: Proactively address the main questions and objections you've identified in your business plan.

-   **Heading**: **"Frequently Asked Questions"**
-   **Layout**: Use the `Accordion` component to keep the section clean and allow users to easily find answers.
-   **shadcn/ui Components**: `Accordion`
-   **Content**:
    -   **"How much does it cost?"**: Frame the answer around affordability compared to a permanent ramp. "Our rentals are a fraction of the cost of a $3,000+ permanent installation..."
    -   **"What if we need it permanently?"**: Position the rental as a "try before you buy" solution. "Perfect! Our rental service is the ideal way to test a configuration before you commit to a permanent build."
    -   **"Does insurance cover this?"**: Be direct and turn it into a positive. "We know Medicare and most insurance plans don't cover rampsâ€”that's exactly why we created this affordable, direct-pay service."
    -   **"How quickly can you install?"**: Reiterate your core promise. "We can often install within 24 hours of your request, especially for urgent needs like hospital discharges."

### 7. Final Call-to-Action: The Final Push

**Goal**: Make it incredibly easy to get in touch and convert the visitor into a lead.

-   **Heading**: **"Get Your Free Quote Today"**
-   **Sub-heading**: "Don't let stairs be a barrier. Contact us now for a fast, no-obligation quote and get the safe access you need."
-   **Layout**: A simple, two-column layout with contact information on one side and a form on the other.
-   **shadcn/ui Components**: `Form`, `Input`, `Label`, `Textarea`, `Button`. Use `Alert` to show a confirmation message after the form is submitted.
-   **Contact Info**: Clearly display your phone number and email address for those who prefer to call or email directly.
