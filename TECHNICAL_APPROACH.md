# Technical Approach for the Same Day Ramps Website

This document outlines the modern technical best practices we will follow to build a simple, fast, and maintainable Next.js website for Same Day Ramps, optimized for deployment on Vercel.

## 1. Architecture: Simplicity and Speed with the App Router

Our primary goal is to minimize the amount of JavaScript sent to the client. A smaller client bundle means faster page loads, better interactivity, and a higher Lighthouse score.

-   **React Server Components (RSCs) by Default**: We will leverage the Next.js App Router. All components will be Server Components by default. This means the rendering work is done on the server, and only HTML and minimal JavaScript are sent to the browser, leading to excellent performance.
-   **"Use Client" Sparingly**: The `"use client"` directive will only be used for components that require interactivity (e.g., components using `useState`, `useEffect`, or event listeners). Our `Form` and interactive `Tabs` will be the main client components. The vast majority of the site will be static.
-   **Static First**: The entire site will be statically generated at build time. This provides the fastest possible experience for visitors as pages are served from Vercel's Edge Network (CDN). We will use Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) if any content needs to be updated periodically, but for this project, a simple static build is likely sufficient.

## 2. Asset Optimization: Fonts and Images

Assets are often the biggest performance bottlenecks. We will optimize them from the start.

-   **Image Optimization with `next/image`**:
    -   All images on the site will use the `<Image>` component from `next/image`.
    -   This provides automatic optimization: resizing, format conversion (WebP/AVIF), and lazy loading.
    -   We will provide `width` and `height` props to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
    -   The hero image will use the `priority` prop to ensure it is preloaded for a fast Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).

-   **Font Optimization with `next/font`**:
    -   We will use `next/font` to self-host our web fonts (e.g., Google Fonts).
    -   This eliminates the need for an extra network request to Google's servers, improving load times and privacy.
    -   It automatically sets `font-display: swap` and uses the `size-adjust` property to prevent layout shifts as the font loads.

## 3. Code & Dependencies

-   **Dynamic Imports for Non-Critical Components**: If we add any complex, interactive components that are not essential for the initial page view (e.g., a video player modal), we will load them using `next/dynamic`. This will keep them out of the initial JavaScript bundle.
-   **Third-Party Scripts with `next/script`**: Any third-party scripts (like analytics) will be loaded using the `<Script>` component from `next/script`. We will use the `strategy="afterInteractive"` to ensure these scripts load without blocking page rendering.
-   **Bundle Analysis**: We will use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to periodically check our JavaScript bundle size and identify any unnecessarily large packages that might have been added.

## 4. Deployment & Hosting: Vercel

The application will be deployed on Vercel to take full advantage of the platform's tight integration with Next.js.

-   **Git Integration**: We will connect the project's Git repository for seamless continuous deployment. Every `git push` to the `main` branch will trigger a production deployment.
-   **Vercel Analytics**: We will enable Vercel Analytics to monitor our Core Web Vitals with real user data. This allows us to see how the site performs for actual visitors and identify any performance regressions over time.
-   **Caching**: Vercel automatically caches static assets on its global Edge Network. By building a static site, we ensure that our content is physically close to our users, resulting in very low latency.

By following this technical approach, we will create a website for Same Day Ramps that is not only visually appealing and strategically sound but also exceptionally fast, reliable, and easy to maintain.
